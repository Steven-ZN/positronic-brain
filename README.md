This is an experimental and modeling-focused repository aiming to **translate Asimov's Three Laws of Robotics into executable logic** for modern large language models (LLMs) and autonomous agents.

We are currently exploring ways to represent and enforce these laws through code, ethical evaluation modules, and decision control layers.

**Status:** Work in progress – design, simulation, and testing underway.

## Project Goal

To implement and validate a functional, modular framework that allows LLMs or agentic systems to reason with and act under constraints aligned with:

1. Do no harm to humans.
2. Obey human commands unless doing so causes harm.
3. Preserve self-existence unless doing so causes harm or disobedience.

## Vision

From science fiction to executable ethics — building a bridge between abstract moral directives and real-world AI behavior control.

## Framework Overview

The repository now includes a starter Python package, `positronic_brain`, with modules for actions, ethics evaluation, and a simple agent implementation. Unit tests demonstrate how an agent consults the evaluator before performing an action.

**This is not just safety. This is moral architecture.**
